//THEMES
//figure out what you want to have be dynamic in the theme. probably backgrounds,images,
//colors of course and see if you can do dynamic favicons
//nice bright grad as an option, different colors for footer

//how to transition between components mounting?
//attach meta og tags to html file before you are done
